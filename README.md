# Pokémon Emerald "Definitive Edition"

A fun little side project for personal use that modernizes Pokémon Emerald with fixes and new features.

## Bug Fixes

These are bugs that were present in the official release of Pokémon Emerald.

- Fixed surfing dismount ground effects.
- Fixed broken RNG.
  - Game Freak forgot to re-enable RTC-based RNG after development on FireRed/LeafGreen, which left it broken and predictable.

These are bugs in the official release that were either non-problematic or in features that were unused.

- Prevent moving camera from triggering ground effects.
- Fixed snowy weather.
- Dex entries are no longer shown if you've caught a Pokémon without a Pokédex.

## Quality of Life Improvements

Implementing features and changes, many of which were introduced in newer entries of the series.

- TMs are no longer limited-use, and cannot be sold, tossed, or re-bought.

- Removed save overwrite confirmation.
- Name entry automatically switches to lowercase after the first letter.
